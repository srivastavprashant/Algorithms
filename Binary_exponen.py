# binary exponentiation
# Computing a^n in log n time instead of Regular O(N)
# can be used with any property which is Associative (X.Y).Z = X.(Y.Z)
"""
Example: 3^13= can be written as 3^ ((1101)base2) as 1101 is 13
So, 3^8 + 3^4 + 3^1 = 3^13 , here bit 2 is unset

So a^n= {   1             if n==0
        {   (a^(n/2) )^2  if n>0 and n even
        {   (a^((n-1)/2))^2 . a     if n>0 and n odd
